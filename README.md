## Dataset Information

In this project, Rain in Tomorrow dataset was used. This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations. The target RainTomorrow means: Did it rain the next day? Yes or No. (a binary classification problem). 

## Requirements

There are some general library requirements for the Project. The general requirements are as follows.
 *	Numpy
 *	Pandas
 *	Scikit-learn
 
For Visualization
 *	Matplotlib
 *	Seaborn
 *	Plotly
 *	Missingno

The library requirements specific to some methods are:
 *	XGboost Classifier
 *	Light-GBM Classifier
 *	CatBoost Classifier
 *  GradientBoosting Classifier
 *	Logistic Regression

## Content
This dataset contains daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations such as Rainfall, Wind and Humidity.
The following steps were followed in this project:
 *	Exploratory data analysis
 *	Visualization
 *	Split data into training and test set
 *	Feature Engineering
